### Presenting at pdxruby

Interested in presenting at pdxruby? We would love to have you!

Here's what to do:

1.  Send a quick note to the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/pdxruby)
    and we'll let you know when there's room on the schedule. We aim to
    announce speakers about two weeks before the monthly meeting.
2.  Prepare your presentation. This can be anything from a quick
    lightning talk with whiteboard drawings to an hour-long tour de
    force with 200 immaculately-designed slides.
3.  Show up and share your knowledge! If you need the projector, be sure
    to bring any adapters you need to connect via VGA.

Looking for inspiration? Take a look through some of our [past presentations](/past-presenters) or peruse the [list of suggested presentations](/suggested-presentations).

If you're not quite ready to present, you can add your name to the
[potential presenters](/potential-presenters)
list and we'll check in with you occasionally.

### Help us find speakers!

We're always on the lookout for speakers for pdxruby meetings, so if you
know someone you'd like to see present, please make an introduction. You
can also add to the list of [suggested presentations](/suggested-presentations) if
there's a topic you'd like to learn more about.
