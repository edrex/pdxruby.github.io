Job Posting Guidelines
======================

We've had many job postings on the list, and we don't want them to stop.
However, we do ask you follow a few guidelines to help you be more
successful.

Please…

-   start the subject of your email with **[JOB]**. (Not **(JOB)**, not
    **{JOB}**, not **[JOB!!!1!eleventy!!]**. Please use **[JOB]**.)
-   Include a way for people to reach you, especially if you want people
    to use a different email address than the one you're posting with.
-   wait at least a month before reposting a job
-   only post jobs within 100 miles of Portland or run it by a moderator
    first.
-   don't copy/paste some corporate description. They are too
    boilerplate and vague for us.
-   avoid buzzwords. If you want a ninja rockstar to roflscale your
    project, you're looking in the wrong place.
-   don't post a description that came right from your lawyer's lips.
    Descriptions that sound like they're from a human do much better.
-   keep the descriptions short, technical & clear.
-   tell us about the culture, not just the benefits.
-   read and respond to comments on the mailing list regarding your
    post.
-   take a look at several well-received posts

        Lead](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pdxruby/96JcC1sbCUQ/NdQSG1v1esUJ)
-   take a look at what we don't care for
    -   [Sr. Ruby

If you have any questions about posting a job, please send a message to
the organizers on Meetup. Also, please ask before posting a job message
via Meetup. It's a newer addition to our organization and we want to be
careful in its use.

Job Replying Guidelines
=======================

We want all of our members to enjoy fruitful, satisfying careers. To
that end, when replying to a job posting on the list, *please consider
composing your reply in a separate email to the sender*. Not only does
this eliminate the context of your email—giving you an opportunity to
present yourself to the potential employer free of mailing list
cruft—but it eliminates the **sole greatest source of shame and
embarrassment on the pdxruby list: the reply-all job inquiry**. Don't be
that person.
